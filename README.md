# Word-Cloud
## Project Overview

This mini-project focuses on building a dynamic **Word Cloud** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application displays words with randomly generated font sizes and allows users to add new words dynamically through user input. It includes basic input validation and updates the UI in real time based on user interactions.

## Features
- Dynamically generates words with random font sizes
- Allows users to add new words to the word cloud
- Displays an error message for empty input
- Updates the UI without page reloads

## What I Learned
- Creating and appending DOM elements dynamically
- Generating and applying random styles using JavaScript
- Handling user input and validation
- Implementing interactive UI behavior using event listeners
